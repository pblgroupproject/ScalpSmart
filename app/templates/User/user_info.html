              <div class="stageText">
                  It marks the beginning of hair loss, usually manifesting as slight thinning around the temples or the front hairline. This stage is often characterized by minimal to no significant changes in overall hair density.

              <div class="stageText">
                  At this stage, hair loss becomes more evident, with noticeable thinning spreading across the crown of the head. Individuals may observe increased shedding and a reduction in hair volume, especially at the top of the scalp.

              <div class="stageText">
                  Hair loss progresses further, leading to more extensive thinning throughout the crown and frontal areas. Scalp visibility increases as hair density continues to decrease, often resulting in a more pronounced appearance of bald spots and a receding hairline.

                  This final stage is characterized by significant hair loss, with large areas of the scalp devoid of hair. Individuals may experience complete baldness on the top of the head, with only sparse hair remaining along the sides and back, if at all.

      <h3>Normal Stage</h3>
      <div class="line mt-1 mb-5"></div>

      <div class="infoContainer">
          <div class="textDiv">
              In this stage, individuals experience the typical cycle of hair growth, known as the anagen phase, where hair follicles are actively growing. This phase lasts for several years before transitioning into the catagen phase, a short transitional phase, and then the telogen phase, where hair sheds and new growth begins. 
              <br><br>
              Shedding in this stage is minimal, with most individuals losing around 50-100 hairs per day. Remedies for maintaining healthy hair in this stage include a balanced diet rich in nutrients like vitamins A, C, D, E, and B vitamins, along with regular scalp massages to stimulate circulation and promote hair growth.

              <div class="image" style="background-image: url('https://www.hairpalace.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/10-signs-of-balding.jpg');"></div>
          </div>
          <div class="textDiv">
              Stage 1 marks the initial phase of hair loss, often characterized by minimal changes that may go unnoticed by some individuals. Hair thinning typically occurs around the temples or the front hairline, where the hair follicles may start to miniaturize due to genetic factors or hormonal changes. 
              <br><br>
              Remedies at this stage often involve using over-the-counter minoxidil solutions to promote hair growth and prevent further thinning. Additionally, maintaining a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition, stress management, and avoiding harsh hair treatments can help preserve existing hair.

          <div class="textDiv">
              In Stage 2, hair loss becomes more apparent, with noticeable thinning spreading across the crown of the head. This stage is often associated with an increase in shedding and a reduction in hair volume, leading to a visibly thinner appearance. 
              <br><br>
              Remedies may include prescription medications like finasteride, which works to inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone implicated in hair loss. Hair transplant procedures may also be considered for those seeking a more permanent solution to restore hair density in affected areas.

              Hair loss progresses further in Stage 3, with extensive thinning throughout the crown and frontal areas. Scalp visibility increases as hair density continues to decrease, resulting in a more pronounced appearance of bald spots and a receding hairline. 
              <br><br>
              Remedies at this stage often involve more aggressive interventions, such as advanced hair restoration techniques like follicular unit extraction (FUE) or follicular unit transplantation (FUT). These procedures involve transplanting hair follicles from donor areas to areas of thinning or baldness to achieve natural-looking results.

          </div>
          <div class="textDiv">
              At this final stage, significant hair loss results in large areas of the scalp being devoid of hair. Complete baldness on the top of the head may occur, with only sparse hair remaining along the sides and back, if at all. 
              <br><br>
              Remedies for baldness may include cosmetic solutions such as wigs or hairpieces to conceal bald spots, or more permanent options like scalp micropigmentation, where pigments are tattooed onto the scalp to simulate the appearance of a closely shaved head. In some cases, acceptance and embracing one's baldness may be the most empowering remedy, coupled with confidence and self-assurance.
